                    I began programming as a hobby in 2021 and
                    taught myself Python. After graduating high school, I
                    pursued programming further by enrolling in KITM, where I
                    learned both front-end and back-end web development. During
                    my time at KITM, I gained experience working with various
                    technologies such as React, React Native, Node, SQL and many
                    others. I am passionate about programming and am always
                    eager to learn and expand my skill set.
