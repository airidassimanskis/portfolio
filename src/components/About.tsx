                Hi, I'm Airidas, I began programming as a hobby in 2021 and
                taught myself Python. After graduating high school, I pursued
                programming further by enrolling in KITM, where I learned both
                front-end and back-end web development. During my time at KITM,
                I gained experience working with various technologies such as
                React, React Native, Node, SQL and many others. I am passionate
                about programming and am always eager to learn and expand my
                skill set.
